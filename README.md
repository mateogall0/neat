# NEAT algorithm example
This repository uses the Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm to predict datasets as in supervised learning.

## Requirements
The project runs on Python and its requirements can be fetched from the `requirements.txt` file. You can also install all of them using the following command at root:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Train
To train the model you can run the Python script `train.py`. At the end it will plot the evolution of the fitness and the evolution of the model size.
